# The TExtditor

## Description

The TExtditor is an easy-to-use text editor that is a progressive web application. It can be downloaded as an app onto your computer and works offline!

## Usage

Usage is pretty simple: you are presented with a page to type in, with each of the lines numbered. Type whatever you want into it, and indexedDB will save that data for later. To install the editor as an app, just hit the 'install' button and you will be taken straight to the open app page. In the background a service worker allows the app to function properly even offline!

## Credits

Lots of help from stackoverflow and the chrome docs about service workers, and other stuff taken from previous assignments, but the rest of the code is my own
